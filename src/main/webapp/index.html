	<p>This piece of canvas is your world. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let your imagination be your guide. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Work that paint.</p>

	<p>I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. You can create anything that makes you happy. See there, told you that would be easy.</p>
